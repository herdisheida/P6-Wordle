## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.4+ (for `pathlib` support)  

## Rules
Wordle is a daily word-guessing game where the goal is to deduce the hidden word using logic and process of elimination. Players set their own rules; choosing X attempts to guess a Y-letter word. They then receive feedback (C=correct letter/position, c=correct letter/wrong position, -=incorrect letter) after each try. 



### Usage
```bash
cd <your-project-folder>
python3 start.py
```
